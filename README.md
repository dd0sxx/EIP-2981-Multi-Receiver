# EIP-2981-Multi-Reciever

This repository is a standard smart contract for distributing royalties to multiple recievers.
EIP-2981 only allows for singular addresses, and requires external contract implementations to distribute royalties to multiple parties. This contract aims to be an easy solution for anyone looking to have such functionality.

All the basic Hardhat commands work in this repo:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
